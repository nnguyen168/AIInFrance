### 1.Creating ensembles from submission files
The most basic and convenient way to ensemble is to ensemble Kaggle submission CSV files.

- Voting ensembles

==> majority vote make it rarer to be corrupted

- Correlation

==> A lower correlation

==> Weighting

- Averaging

==> Rank averaging

### 2.Stacked Generalization & Blending
The serious gains start with stacking and blending.

- Stacked generalization

==> Stacking with logistic regression

==> Stacking with non-linear algorithms

- Blending
